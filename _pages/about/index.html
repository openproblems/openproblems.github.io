Vindas Meléndez, who I am doing research under. I am also an undergraduate intern in a toplogical combinatorics lab organized by Professor Minki Kim.</p> <p>I have worked on Ehrhart Theory, Posets and Kazhdan-Lusztig Polynomials, and hope to dive deeper into Coxeter Groups and Schubert Calculus.</p> </body></html>
