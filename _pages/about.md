<!---Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.-->
I am a third year undergraduate student of Gwanju Institute of Science and Technology majoring in CS and minoring in Mathematics.

I have attended UC Berkeley as an exchange student for a year, and was fortunate to meet Professor Andr\'es R. Vindas Mel\'endez who I am doing research under the supervision of.

I am also an undergraduate intern in a toplogical combinatorics lab organized by Professor Minki Kim. My current fields of interests are Algebraic Combinatorics, Geometric Combinatorics and Topological Combinatorics.

I have worked on Ehrhart Theory, Posets and Kazhdan-Lusztig Polynomials, and hope to dive deeper into Coxeter Groups and Schubert Calculus.

I am aiming to apply in algebraic combinatorics graduate programs in the U.S. and Canada.
