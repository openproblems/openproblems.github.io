I am a third year undergraduate student of Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology majoring in CS and minoring in Mathematics.

My current fields of interests are Algebraic Combinatorics, Geometric Combinatorics and Topological Combinatorics.

I have attended UC Berkeley as an exchange student for a year, and was fortunate to meet Professor Andrés R. Vindas Meléndez, who I am doing research under. I am also an undergraduate intern in a toplogical combinatorics lab organized by Professor Minki Kim.

I have worked on Ehrhart Theory, Posets and Kazhdan-Lusztig Polynomials, and hope to dive deeper into Coxeter Groups and Schubert Calculus.
